# Crisis Response Guide

Welcome to the Crisis Response Team (CRT) guide. This document provides comprehensive guidance on handling crisis situations within [The Alphabet Cartel](https://discord.gg/alphabetcartel) community.

## Understanding Crisis Levels

The Ash system categorizes crises into three severity levels:

### Critical (Red)
Immediate danger to self or others. Requires immediate CRT response.

**Indicators:**
- Explicit statements of intent to harm self or others
- Detailed plans or timelines
- Access to means
- Goodbye messages or giving away possessions

**Response Time:** Immediate (within minutes)

### High (Orange)
Significant distress that could escalate without intervention.

**Indicators:**
- Expressions of hopelessness or feeling trapped
- Withdrawal from community
- Sudden mood changes
- References to not being around

**Response Time:** Within 1 hour

### Moderate (Yellow)
Elevated distress requiring monitoring and support.

**Indicators:**
- Increased negative self-talk
- Requests for support
- Discussions of past struggles
- General expressions of distress

**Response Time:** Within 4 hours

## Response Protocol

### Step 1: Assess the Situation

When a crisis alert triggers, take a moment to:

1. Read the flagged message(s) carefully
2. Review the user's recent message history
3. Check for any context or triggers
4. Determine the appropriate severity level

### Step 2: Initiate Contact

**Do:**
- Reach out privately via DM
- Use a warm, non-judgmental tone
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Ask open-ended questions

**Don't:**
- Make assumptions about their situation
- Minimize their feelings
- Promise things you can't deliver
- Share details with others without consent

### Step 3: Document

Use the session notes feature in Ash-Dash to:

- Record your observations
- Note actions taken
- Document any resources shared
- Track follow-up needs

### Step 4: Escalate if Needed

If the situation requires additional support:

1. Contact another CRT member
2. Consult with CRT leadership
3. If immediate danger exists, consider emergency services
