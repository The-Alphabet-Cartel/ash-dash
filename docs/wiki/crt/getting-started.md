# Getting Started with Ash-Dash

Welcome to Ash-Dash, the Crisis Response Team dashboard for [The Alphabet Cartel](https://discord.gg/alphabetcartel) community. This guide will walk you through logging in and navigating the dashboard.

## Logging In

Ash-Dash uses **PocketID** for authentication—the same system you use for other Alphabet Cartel services.

### First-Time Login

1. Navigate to the Ash-Dash URL (provided by your CRT lead)
2. Click **"Sign in with PocketID"**
3. Enter your PocketID credentials
4. Grant Ash-Dash permission to access your profile
5. You'll be redirected to the dashboard

### Subsequent Logins

Your session persists for 24 hours. If you're logged out:

1. Visit the Ash-Dash URL
2. You'll be automatically redirected to PocketID
3. Confirm your login (or enter credentials if session expired)
4. Return to where you left off

### Troubleshooting Login

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Unauthorized" error | Contact CRT leadership—you may not be in the CRT group |
| Login loop | Clear browser cookies and try again |
| PocketID down | Wait and retry; check Discord for announcements |

## Dashboard Overview

After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard with four key areas:

### 1. Sidebar Navigation

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Real-time metrics and active sessions |
| **Sessions** | Full session history with search/filter |
| **Archives** | Encrypted long-term storage |
| **Wiki** | Documentation and training materials |
| **Admin** | System management (leads/admins only) |

**Tip:** Click the collapse button at the bottom of the sidebar to maximize your workspace.

### 2. Metric Cards

Four cards showing key statistics:

- **Active Sessions** — Crisis sessions needing attention
- **Critical/High** — Urgent sessions requiring immediate response
- **This Week** — Total sessions in the past 7 days
- **CRT Online** — Members currently handling sessions

### 3. Charts

- **Crisis Trends** — 30-day trend showing session volume
- **CRT Activity** — Team response patterns over 7 days

### 4. Active Sessions Panel

Live list of sessions requiring attention, sorted by severity:

- 🟣 **Critical** — Immediate danger, respond NOW
- 🔴 **High** — Significant distress, respond within 1 hour
- 🟡 **Medium** — Elevated concern, respond within 4 hours
- 🟢 **Low** — Minor concern, monitor
- ⚪ **Safe** — No immediate concern

## Quick Actions

### Viewing a Session

1. Click any session in the Active Sessions panel
2. Or navigate to **Sessions** and click a row

### Refreshing Data

- Data auto-refreshes every 10 seconds (sessions) and 30 seconds (metrics)
- Click the **Refresh** button for immediate update
- The "Live" indicator shows real-time polling is active

### Changing Themes

Click the **sun/moon icon** in the sidebar to toggle between:
- 🌙 Dark mode (default—easier on eyes during night shifts)
- ☀️ Light mode

### Editing Your Profile

Click the **external link icon** next to your name in the sidebar to open PocketID and update your profile information.

### Logging Out

Click the **logout icon** next to your name in the sidebar.

## Understanding Session States

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Session is open and needs monitoring |
| **Closed** | Session resolved, CRT intervention complete |
| **Archived** | Session encrypted and moved to long-term storage |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Tab` | Navigate between elements |
| `Enter` | Activate buttons/links |
| `Escape` | Close modals |

## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the basics:

1. Read the [Session Management Guide](./session-management.md)
2. Review the [Crisis Response Guide](./Ash-Dash%20-%20crisis-response-guide.md)
