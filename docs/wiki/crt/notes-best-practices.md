# Notes Best Practices

Effective documentation is crucial for crisis response. This guide covers how to write clear, useful session notes in Ash-Dash for [The Alphabet Cartel](https://discord.gg/alphabetcartel) community.

## Why Notes Matter

Session notes serve multiple purposes:

- **Continuity** — Other CRT members can pick up where you left off
- **Patterns** — Help identify recurring issues for a user
- **Learning** — Training resource for new CRT members
- **Accountability** — Record of actions taken
- **Improvement** — Data for improving our processes

## The Notes Editor

Ash-Dash uses a rich text editor with formatting options:

### Formatting Toolbar

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **B** | Bold text |
| *I* | Italic text |
| <u>U</u> | Underline text |
| ~~S~~ | Strikethrough |
| 🔗 | Insert link |
| • | Bullet list |
| 1. | Numbered list |
| ☐ | Task list (checkboxes) |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` | Bold |
| `Ctrl+I` | Italic |
| `Ctrl+U` | Underline |
| `Ctrl+K` | Insert link |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Save note |

## Note Structure

### Recommended Format

```
## [Timestamp] - [Your Name]

**Assessment:**
Brief summary of the situation

**Actions Taken:**
- What you did
- Who you contacted
- Resources shared

**User Response:**
How the user reacted

**Next Steps:**
- Follow-up needed
- Handoff notes
```

### Example Note

```
## 2026-01-10 14:30 - Alex

**Assessment:**
User expressing hopelessness after job loss. No immediate 
danger indicators but elevated distress. Second session 
this month.

**Actions Taken:**
- Reached out via DM
- Practiced active listening
- Shared Trevor Project resources
- Offered to connect with community support

**User Response:**
Receptive to conversation. Expressed appreciation for 
outreach. Agreed to reach out if feelings intensify.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Check in tomorrow
- [ ] Monitor for new flags
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Factual

✅ "User stated they felt hopeless"
❌ "User seemed really depressed"

✅ "Shared 988 hotline information"
❌ "Tried to help them"

### Be Specific

✅ "Conversation lasted 45 minutes via Discord DM"
❌ "Talked for a while"

✅ "User mentioned recent breakup as trigger"
❌ "User is going through stuff"

### Be Concise

Notes should be thorough but scannable. Use:

- Bullet points for actions
- Bold for key terms
- Short paragraphs
- Clear headers

### Protect Privacy

- Use Discord usernames, not real names (unless user shares)
- Don't include identifying details beyond what's necessary
- Remember notes may be reviewed by CRT leadership

## Types of Notes

### Initial Assessment

First note when you engage with a session:

```
## Initial Assessment - [Name]

**Severity:** [Your assessment]
**Risk Factors:** [What concerns you]
**Context:** [Relevant background]
**Plan:** [What you'll do next]
```

### Progress Update

Updates during an ongoing intervention:

```
## Update - [Name]

**Status:** [Better/Same/Worse]
**Actions:** [What you did]
**Response:** [How user responded]
```

### Handoff Note

When passing to another CRT member:

```
## Handoff to [Next Person] - [Name]

**Current Status:** [Where things stand]
**What's Been Done:** [Summary of actions]
**What's Needed:** [Recommended next steps]
**Key Context:** [Important details they need]
```

### Closing Summary

When closing a session:

```
## Session Closed - [Name]

**Resolution:** [How it resolved]
**Duration:** [How long intervention lasted]
**Resources Shared:** [What you provided]
**Follow-up:** [Any planned check-ins]
```

## Using Task Lists

Task lists help track follow-ups:

```
## Follow-up Tasks

- [x] Initial outreach completed
- [x] Resources shared
- [ ] 24-hour check-in
- [ ] Update CRT lead on outcome
```

Check off items as you complete them. This creates a clear record of what's done and what remains.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Vague

❌ "Talked to user. They're okay now."

✅ "30-minute conversation via DM. User expressed feeling better after discussing coping strategies. Agreed to reach out if feelings return. Planning 24-hour check-in."

### 2. Too Much Personal Opinion

❌ "I think this user is just attention-seeking."

✅ "User has had 3 sessions this month. Each resolved after initial outreach. Consider discussing pattern with CRT lead."

### 3. Missing Timestamps

❌ "Reached out to user."

✅ "2026-01-10 14:30 - Reached out to user via DM."

### 4. No Follow-up Plan

❌ "User feeling better. Closing session."

✅ "User feeling better. Will check in tomorrow. Closing session but monitoring for new flags."

## Collaborative Notes

Multiple CRT members may work the same session. Tips:

- **Start with your name** so others know who wrote what
- **Read existing notes** before adding yours
- **Reference previous notes** ("Following up on Alex's outreach...")
- **Don't duplicate** — add new information, don't repeat

## Sensitive Situations

For especially sensitive cases:

- Document facts, not judgments
- Note if user requested confidentiality
- Flag for CRT leadership review if appropriate
- Consider whether details need to be in notes vs. verbal handoff

## Notes and Archives

When a session is archived:

- Notes are encrypted along with the session
- Notes become read-only
- Archived notes can be retrieved by admins if needed

**Tip:** Write notes assuming they may be reviewed months later. Include enough context for someone unfamiliar with the case.
