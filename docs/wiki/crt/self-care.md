# Self-Care for CRT Members

Being a Crisis Response Team member is rewarding but emotionally demanding work. This guide provides strategies and resources to help you maintain your own wellbeing while supporting others.

## Why Self-Care Matters

You cannot pour from an empty cup. Taking care of yourself isn't selfish—it's essential for:

- Sustainable service to the community
- Making clear, compassionate decisions
- Modeling healthy behavior for those we support
- Preventing burnout and compassion fatigue

## Recognizing Burnout

### Warning Signs

Watch for these signs in yourself:

- **Emotional exhaustion**: Feeling drained, overwhelmed, or emotionally numb
- **Detachment**: Distancing yourself from the work or community
- **Reduced effectiveness**: Feeling like nothing you do makes a difference
- **Physical symptoms**: Sleep issues, headaches, frequent illness
- **Irritability**: Short temper, frustration with community members

### When to Take a Break

It's okay—and encouraged—to step back when:

- You've handled multiple difficult sessions in a row
- You're personally going through a hard time
- You notice burnout warning signs
- You simply need rest

**Your wellbeing comes first.** The team will cover for you.

## Self-Care Strategies

### Immediate (During/After Sessions)

1. **Grounding techniques**
   - 5-4-3-2-1 method (5 things you see, 4 hear, 3 feel, 2 smell, 1 taste)
   - Deep breathing exercises
   - Physical movement or stretching

2. **Transition rituals**
   - Change your environment after difficult sessions
   - Do something that brings you joy
   - Talk to a trusted person

3. **Boundaries**
   - It's okay to hand off a session to another CRT member
   - You don't have to be available 24/7
   - Quality over quantity

### Ongoing Practices

- **Regular check-ins** with CRT leadership or mentor
- **Peer support** - debrief with fellow CRT members
- **Professional support** - therapy or counseling
- **Physical health** - sleep, nutrition, movement
- **Joy and connection** - hobbies, relationships outside CRT

## Using the Buddy System

For particularly difficult sessions:

1. Reach out to another CRT member before engaging
2. Keep them updated during the session
3. Debrief together afterward
4. Check in with each other the next day

**You don't have to do this alone.**

## Remember

> "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." — Audre Lorde

You chose to be part of CRT because you care. That same care must extend to yourself.

**We appreciate you.** 💜
