# Ash-Dash Crisis Response Guide

This guide provides crisis response protocols for [The Alphabet Cartel](https://discord.gg/alphabetcartel) CRT members using Ash-Dash.

> **New to Ash-Dash?** Start with the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) to learn how to log in and navigate the dashboard.

## Understanding Crisis Levels

The Ash system categorizes crises into five severity levels:

| Level | Color | Indicators | Response Time |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------|
| 🟣 **Critical** | Purple | Immediate danger, explicit intent, means/plan | **Immediate** (within minutes) |
| 🔴 **High** | Red | Significant distress, hopelessness, could escalate | Within 1 hour |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Yellow | Elevated concern, requests for support | Within 4 hours |
| 🟢 **Low** | Green | Minor concern, venting | Monitor |
| ⚪ **Safe** | Gray | No crisis indicators | No action |

### Critical Indicators
- Explicit statements of intent to harm self or others
- Detailed plans or timelines
- Access to means
- Goodbye messages or giving away possessions

### High Indicators
- Expressions of hopelessness or feeling trapped
- Withdrawal from community
- Sudden mood changes
- References to "not being around"

### Medium Indicators
- Increased negative self-talk
- Requests for support
- Discussions of past struggles
- General expressions of distress

## Response Protocol

### Step 1: Review the Session

When you see an alert in Ash-Dash:

1. Click the session to view details
2. Read the flagged message(s) carefully
3. Check the Ash Analysis panel for NLP insights
4. Review user history for patterns

> **See:** [Session Management Guide](./session-management.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Assess Severity

Use your judgment alongside Ash's analysis:

- Does the NLP score match what you're reading?
- Is there context Ash might have missed?
- Has this user had previous sessions?

### Step 3: Reach Out

**Do:**
- Reach out privately via Discord DM
- Use a warm, non-judgmental tone
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Ask open-ended questions
- Let them guide the conversation

**Don't:**
- Make assumptions about their situation
- Minimize their feelings
- Promise things you can't deliver
- Share details with others without consent
- Try to "fix" everything immediately

### Step 4: Document Everything

Add notes to the session as you work:

- Your initial assessment
- Actions taken (DM sent, resources shared)
- User's response
- Follow-up plans

> **See:** [Notes Best Practices](./notes-best-practices.md) for documentation guidelines.

### Step 5: Close or Escalate

**Close the session when:**
- Crisis has passed
- User is stable
- Appropriate resources have been shared
- Follow-up plan is documented

**Escalate when:**
- Immediate danger exists
- You feel unsure or overwhelmed
- The situation is complex
- It involves minors

## Escalation Procedures

### Within CRT

1. Reach out to another online CRT member
2. Post in #crt-urgent for team awareness
3. Contact CRT Leadership directly if needed

### Emergency Services

For **immediate danger to life**, consider:

1. Ask user's general location (country/region)
2. Encourage them to call local emergency services
3. If user is unresponsive and location known, contact appropriate authorities

> **Note:** Always prioritize the user's autonomy when possible. Emergency services are a last resort.

## After the Session

### Documentation

Ensure your notes cover:
- What happened
- What you did
- What the user needs next
- Any follow-up required

### Handoff (if needed)

If you can't complete follow-up yourself:
- Add a handoff note with context
- Tag the next CRT member
- Communicate in #crt-discussion

### Self-Care

Crisis response is emotionally demanding. After difficult sessions:
- Take a break
- Debrief with a peer
- Practice grounding techniques
- Remember: **you matter too** 💜
