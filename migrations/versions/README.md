# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains Alembic database migration scripts.

## Naming Convention

Migration files follow the pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMM_<revision>_<slug>.py
```

Example: `20260107_0615_abc123_initial_schema.py`

## Commands

Run migrations from within the Docker container:

```bash
# Generate a new migration (autogenerate from models)
docker exec ash-dash alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply all pending migrations
docker exec ash-dash alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
docker exec ash-dash alembic downgrade -1

# Show current revision
docker exec ash-dash alembic current

# Show migration history
docker exec ash-dash alembic history
```

## Important

- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on a copy of production data before deploying
- Never edit applied migrations - create new ones instead
